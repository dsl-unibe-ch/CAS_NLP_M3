    "#  Using Ollama Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces **function calling with Ollama**, a powerful way to extend large language models (LLMs) by connecting them to external tools, APIs, or custom Python functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just generating text, the model can decide **when to call a function**, pass the right arguments, and then use the returned result to produce a more accurate and useful response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this workflow, you can:  \n",
    "-  Enable the model to perform actions beyond text generation  \n",
    "-  Safely structure inputs and outputs using JSON  \n",
    "-  Connect to real-world data sources (e.g., weather APIs, databases, calculators)  \n",
    "-  Build interactive and more intelligent applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:  \n",
    "1. Define simple Python functions that the model can call  \n",
    "2. Configure Ollama to use function calling  \n",
    "3. Demonstrate how the model reasons about when and how to call functions  "

    "multiplied by 2.37892, I think that's the main question. Let me proceed with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first, I need to multiply 0.873632 by 2.37892. Let me write that down. Let me recall how\n",

    "complicated. Alternatively, I can use a calculator, but since I need to do it manually, let me\n",

    "numbers have decimal points, I need to consider the total number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, I can use the standard multiplication method for decimals. Let me try that.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me ignore the decimal points and multiply 873632 by 237892. Then, adjust the\n",
    "decimal places accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, that might be a lot of digits. Let me check:\n",
    "\n",
    "0.873632 has 6 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.37892 has 5 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
