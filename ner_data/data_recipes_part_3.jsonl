You can do this with a potato masher.\nCool the mixture, then tip it into a jelly bag suspended over a large bowl, or into a large plastic sieve lined with muslin. You need a plastic sieve, as the acidity in the fruit will affect anything metal. Leave overnight so that the juices run through.\nThe next day, measure the liquid. You should end up with 1.4 litres. If you have less, make up the mixture with water. If more, boil to evaporate the excess. Meanwhile, sterilise your jars and put a small plate in the freezer to chill.\nReturn the liquid to the pan and add the sugar. Heat until dissolved, then bring to the boil, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface, and allow to cook for about 20 mins. Use a sugar thermometer to take the temperature up to 105C or, after 15 mins, start checking it\u2019s set by dropping the mixture onto a chilled plate. When it is ready, the mixture will appear set when you push your finger through. The drips that come off the spoon will also look syrupy. Spoon off any remaining scum and stir in the Port.

(Using unrefined sugar will give the buttercream a natural caramel flavour.) Beat in the cooled ganache.\nTo make the antlers, combine the sugar and butter with the vanilla paste until amalgamated but not creamed. Add the egg and combine. Mix the flour with the spices then tip that in\u00a0and mix to form a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. Roll out on a floured surface to a 5/6mm thickness.

Cut large teardrop shapes from the lighter\u00a0icing to form the ears (about 6cm in size) and\u00a0stick the lighter shape on top of the darker icing\u00a0with a little water. Cut a larger teardrop around the lighter shape. Fold and pinch together at the base, push a cocktail stick into the bottom of each one and set\u00a0aside to firm up.\nTrim the cakes flat if they have a little hump where they have been baked. Put the first layer\u00a0onto a 16cm cake board and\u00a0use a little of the chocolate frosting to secure it to the board. Spread\u00a0frosting over the first layer then\u00a0add layer two.\u00a0Sandwich together by pressing gently and add another layer of frosting to this layer. For the last layer, take the sponge and invert it on top of the other two cakes, so that the smooth part of the cake \u2013 that was on the bottom of the tin \u2013becomes the top. This will make it nice and neat.

Mark out the eyes with a cutter so you can see where to add them. Roll little strips of black fondant icing for the eyes and lashes, then stick these onto the cake. Mould the nose with red fondant icing\u00a0and stick it on with a cocktail stick, pushing one end into the nose and the other into the cake.\nFor the little collar, roll out about 100g of green fondant icing on a surface dusted with icing sugar and cut a thin strip for the bow that will fit around the base of the cake. Stick\u00a0the ends together with a little water, then\u00a0make a bow by folding another thin strip and stick this onto the collar\u00a0with another dab of water.

Mix with all the other stuffing ingredients and set aside.\nPlace the chicken, breast-side down, on the board. Use a sharp boning knife to cut through the skin on the backbone along the length of the bird. Slowly run your knife down against one side of the ribcage, working down the length of the chicken and keeping close to the bone. As you cut, use the other hand to gently pull away the skin and expose the flesh. Pop out the thigh and wing joints, and cut through where they are attached to the main carcass. Continue cutting down the side of the bird, keeping the knife as close to the carcass as possible, until you reach the ridge of the breast bone, then repeat with the other side.\nTo remove the carcass completely, snap away the wishbone where it joins at the neck end and carefully cut beneath the breast bone \u2013 this is where the skin is at its thinnest, so carefully cut away, then lift and cut away the carcass, as you don\u2019t want to nip or pierce the skin.\nOpen up the chicken, skin-side down, and scrape clean or cut away the thigh bones and any other stray bits of bone or cartilage like the wishbone.

Finally, use a larger chopping knife to cut off the feet and wing tips, but don\u2019t discard them.\nRepeat with the pheasant, but cut the legs off completely so you are left with just the 2 breasts attached by the skin. Cut the legs in half and keep. You should now have the semi-boned chicken, the pheasant breasts, the skinned duck breast and the stuffing. If all that butchery doesn\u2019t appeal, your butcher \u2013 with a bit of warning \u2013 should be able to prepare all the birds to this stage for you.\nTo assemble the roast, open up the chicken, skin-side down. Put a third of the stuffing between 2 pieces of cling film and use a rolling pin to roll it out flat so that it just covers the surface area, then place on top of the chicken. Lay the duck breast in the middle of the stuffing, cover with a layer of stuffing, then add the pheasant breasts, skin-side down. Add a final layer of stuffing and lay the 2 chicken mini fillets on top.\nTuck in the top and bottom edges of the chicken, and pull the two long edges together. Tuck one edge of it over the other so everything is rolled together and neatly encased, then flip over. Using butcher\u2019s string, tie the chicken at regular intervals around the width, then tie it once around the length to hold the stuffing in. Finally, tie the legs together. Can be prepared to this stage and chilled up to 1 day ahead.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Scatter the shallots, thyme and carrot into a roasting tin with the pheasant legs and chicken wing tips. Place the roast on the vegetables and rub all over with the softened butter.

Put the tin in the oven and cook for 1 hr 40 mins until beautifully browned all over, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 68C (or above) when inserted in the middle. Remove, loosely cover with foil, and leave to rest somewhere warm for 30 mins.\nWhile the roast is resting, make the gravy. Place the tin on a low flame if flameproof, or tip the contents into a saucepan if not. Scatter over the flour and cook until light brown. Gradually pour in the mushroom soaking liquid, then the chicken stock. Simmer everything together until you have a smooth, thickened gravy, adding any resting juices from the roast. Season to taste, then strain the gravy through a sieve into another saucepan. When the roast has rested, remove the string, carefully carve into thick slices and sprinkle with thyme."}

Fold the strips of pastry diagonally over the filling, starting from the top until you reach the bottom, creating a lattice pattern. You can now chill the tart for up to 2 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.\nBrush the tart with the egg and sprinkle with the extra sugar. Using the baking parchment, transfer the tart to the hot baking tray. Bake for 20\u201325 mins or until golden brown on top (add an extra 10-15 mins if baking from frozen). Leave to cool for 5 mins before serving with whipped cream or brandy cream."}

Arrange small clumps of coloured sweets onto the trays.\nPut the mints in a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook gently until melted, stirring occasionally with a metal spoon. Once melted completely, remove from the heat immediately, otherwise the mixture will burn and discolour.\nWorking quickly, design your charm shapes (making sure they have a hole for threading the ribbon) by drizzling spoonfuls of the melted mints over the clumps of coloured sweets on the trays \u2013 they will melt into your shape and add interest to your design.\nIf the mixture hardens while you are working, return it to a low heat to soften, but try to make as many as you can in one go \u2013 the more you heat the mixture, the less clear the final charms will be. Leave to set for about 10 mins until hard and cool enough to handle, then remove from the tray by hand \u2013 be careful as they will be quite brittle. Tie a length of ribbon through each charm for hanging on the tree. Pack in a box between sheets of baking parchment so they don\u2019t stick together. Eat within 3-4 days, or keep as a decoration for up to 4 weeks."}
