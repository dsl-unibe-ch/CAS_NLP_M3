Leave the turkey to rest on a warm platter covered with foil \u2013 it will stay warm for about 1 hr. If you want to make turkey gravy, pour the fat off the juices and add the gravy to the roasting tin. Bring to the boil, then pour into a gravy jug. To serve, bring the whole turkey to the table, along with the herbs, if using. Carve onto a hot platter with a little of the hot gravy poured over.

Trim with a knife where the marzipan meets the board, then leave to dry overnight.\n Although homemade marzipan contains raw eggs, the amount of sugar, and lack of moisture, prevents bacteria growing when left at room temperature, so your cake should last for 1-2 months iced. The most important thing is that you don't scrimp on drying time \u2013 once you\u2019ve covered your cake in marzipan it should be left to completely dry out for up to 3 days, before you then cover it with icing. If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week \u2013 as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture.
