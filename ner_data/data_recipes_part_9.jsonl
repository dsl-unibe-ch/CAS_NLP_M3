Leave 2mm of space at the top of each one.\nBring the pan(s) of water back to simmering, then set the reserved bowls of chocolate over to melt them again if they have set.

When they have completely melted and no gelatine streaks remain, stir this into the mango mixture.\nBeat the egg whites until stiff. Add the sugar and beat to a thick, shiny meringue mixture. Fold a little of the mango mixture into the meringue with a big metal spoon or spatula. Gently fold in the rest (you\u2019re trying to get rid of all the meringue streaks, while retaining as much air in the mousse as possible . Ladle into a jug and divide between the glasses. Chill overnight to set.\nTo serve, beat the egg whites until stiff. Add the sugar and beat to a shiny, thick meringue, then beat in the Malibu.

In a large bowl, mix the sugar, flour, cocoa, bicarbonate of soda, spices, orange zest and \u00bc tsp salt. In a jug, whisk the eggs, oil, milk and carrots. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix thoroughly. Divide the mixture between the cases and bake for 30 mins until risen and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\nWhile the cakes are cooking, make the carrot decorations. Mix the orange food colouring into the fondant icing until evenly coloured, then divide into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a cyclinder, about 5cm long, then roll one end a little thinner to create a carrot shape. Use a cocktail stick to make indentations along the sides. Set aside, standing them on their fattest end, to firm up for 30 mins. Now make the chocolate icing. Put the butter, cocoa, icing sugar and milk into a saucepan, and bubble for a few mins, stirring with a small whisk until smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool for 20 mins. For the green coconut \u2018grass\u2019, tip the coconut into a small bowl, add a little green food colouring and mix until evenly coated.\nTo assemble the cakes, first cut a little hole, about 1cm, into the centre of each to \u2018plant\u2019 your carrot later. Stir the icing and spread over the cakes to cover the surface. Push your carrot into the centre, then scatter the green coconut around the edges. Stick a sprig of parsley into the top of each carrot and sprinkle the coconut grass with green edible glitter, if you like. Can be stored in a sealed cake tin for up to 3 days."}

Mix the pomegranate juice, cinnamon, allspice, lemon juice, honey and red wine vinegar together in a large bowl. Brown the pork for 2-3 mins each side, then add all the other ingredients, season and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid, or wrap the dish in foil, then transfer to the oven for 1 hr.\nUncover the dish, remove the pork and set aside. Skim off the fat and place the dish on the hob. Reduce the sauce to a sticky glaze before returning the pork to the dish and basting. Increase the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and return the dish to the oven. Continue cooking for another 45-50 mins until the pork is really tender. Scatter with the pomegranate seeds and serve with green veg or a fresh grain salad, if you like."}
