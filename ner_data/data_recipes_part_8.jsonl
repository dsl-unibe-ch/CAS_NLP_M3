Heavily grease a 16cm hemisphere cake tin and stand on a ramekin on a baking sheet to hold it steady.\nFirst, make the sponges. Using electric beaters or a tabletop mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Pour the eggs in, one at a time, giving the mix a thorough beating before adding the next. If the mix starts to look curdled, add 2 tbsp of the plain flour.

Spread a thick layer of buttercream on top of the cake and sandwich another sponge on top. Spread over another thick layer and sit the final sponge on top. Using a palette knife, coat the entire cake in a thin layer of buttercream and smooth the sides and top carefully, working around the whole cake, scraping off any excess icing. Chill in the freezer for 10 mins or in the fridge for 1 hr until set.\nMeanwhile, put the hemisphere sponge on the smaller cake board and halve horizontally. Fill the middle with some buttercream, sandwich with the top and coat the entire cake in a thin layer of buttercream. Chill in the freezer for 5 mins or in the fridge for 30 mins.\nTake the larger cake out of the fridge/ freezer and coat in another layer of buttercream. Take care when covering this time, as you want a smooth finish to the cake. Running the palette knife under hot water helps smooth over the sides once it is coated completely. Chill again for 5 mins in the freezer.\nCover the hemisphere sponge with buttercream and smooth over with the palette knife. Carefully lift the hemisphere onto the centre of the cake (as the sponge has been frozen you shouldn\u2019t leave finger marks). Press down lightly to set on the buttercream. If there is a gap around the rim, use a small palette knife to fill in with any remaining buttercream. Chill for 10-15 mins.\nMeanwhile, make the eyes and nose using coloured fondant. Roll the black fondant into two balls for the eyes, and five smaller balls for the mouth. Roll the orange fondant into a carrot shape. Leave to set and harden slightly while you make the drippy ganache.\nMake the drippy ganache by mixing the chocolate and oil and microwaving for 30 secs, stirring and then giving it another 30 secs until melted. Transfer to a squeezy bottle, then pour down the edges of the round cake to create the melting snow effect.\nTo finish the cake, stick the eyes to the head using a little remaining buttercream. Poke the wooden dowel into the carrot nose, leaving some poking out to stick it to the face.

Make pointed triangular cardboard tree templates in 3 different sizes (roughly 7.5 x 4cm/6.5 x 3.5cm/5.5 x 3cm). Using these as guides, cut out the tree shapes (see tip, above right).

Dampen the path edges with water and lay the ropes in position. Cut off and roll small pieces from the rest of the icing (and any trimmings), then shape into small snow drifts for the trees to stand in. When the trees are firm, make an indent in the top of each snowdrift with the back of a knife and put each tree into position. Sit the trees on the cake, securing with a little honey underneath.

Cover and cook for 1 hr more until the cabbage is really tender. If at any point the cabbage looks dry, add a splash of water. If there is still liquid in the pan at the end, turn the heat right up to evaporate it. Season with a little salt and serve. The cabbage can be prepared ahead and either chilled or frozen. Then reheat in the pan or in a microwave."}

{"text": "Trim the turkey breast. Its natural shape does not suit the rolled and wrapped Wellington. The thicker neck end can first be trimmed to establish a more cylindrical shape. Trimmings from 2kg/4lb 8oz breasts and upwards, will be enough for the 350g/12oz needed for stuffing. Once trimmed, tie the breast with a 2cm/1in gap between each loop of string, to give a rounded shape.\nHeat 2-3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a large frying pan or roasting tray. Season the turkey before pan frying until golden brown all over. Remove from the pan and cool. The breast can now be refrigerated to firm up before removing the string.\nMake the stuffing: cook the onions in a knob of butter for a few minutes until softened. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Roughly chop the turkey trimmings before blitzing in a food processor until smooth. Add sausages and continue to blitz for 30-40 seconds until mixed in. Season and add the eggs. These can be blitzed into the meat for a further minute until the texture thickens.\nSpoon the stuffing into a large bowl. Mix in the onions and remaining stuffing ingredients along with extra seasoning, if desired. The stuffing can now be chilled while the bacon and pastry are prepared.\nThe streaky bacon needs to be rolled thinner. This extends the length of the rashers helping them to wrap around the turkey and stuffing. The easiest method to follow is to lay 3-5 rashers between two sheets of cling film and press with a rolling pin as if rolling pastry. The rashers will easily thin and extend this way. Peel away the top layer of film and remove the rashers and put on a tray. Repeat until all rashers are pressed. Chill until needed.\nRoll the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle approximately 45 x 35cm/18 x 14in. The rashers of bacon can be laid on top of the pastry, leaving a 3-4cm/1\u00bdin border all round. Slightly overlap the rashers as they are laid on the pastry (you'll need about 14-15 rashers).\nSpread the cranberry stuffing over the bacon, first mixing it well if it is chilled and set. Keep back a few heaped tablespoons. Remove the string from the turkey and lay the breast lengthwise and presentation side down on top of the stuffing. The reserved stuffing can now be spread along the centre top of the turkey. Lift 4-5 rashers at a time and press them against the breast. Continue until all the rashers on both sides have been lifted and pressed. The remaining rashers can now be laid lengthwise along the top, covering the stuffing that was spread there.\nBring one long side of the pastry up and over the turkey. Brush the other long side with beaten egg, along the 3-4cm/1\u00bdin border, then seal. Brush both ends with beaten egg and fold up to seal in all the ingredients. Turn the Wellington so that the presentation side is up and put on a lightly oiled baking tray, or one covered with greased parchment. Chill.\nTo cook the Wellington: preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6/170C in a fan assisted convection oven and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes maximum. After 45 minutes, brush the Wellington with egg to help colour the pastry. For the most golden of finishes, brush again before the last 15-20 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and rest for 15-20 minutes before lifting carefully on to a carving board with two large fish slices.\nWhile the Wellington is baking the sauce can be made: melt a knob of butter in a pan, once bubbling add the shallots or onions and cook on a medium high heat until a rich deep golden colour. Add the honey and continue to cook for a few minutes until bubbling and almost caramelising. At this point add the red wine vinegar and red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by half. Add the water or stock and return to simmer. Mix the flour with 25g/1oz butter. Whisk into the sauce a little at a time until completely whisked in. Return the sauce to the boil before reducing to a simmer and cooking for a few minutes. Strain through a sieve and season. Slice the Wellington and serve with Noisette potatoes and buttered Brussels sprouts."}
{"text": "Combine 125g sugar with all the cream in a heavy-based saucepan. Heat gently, stirring occasionally, until all the sugar has dissolved, then bring to the boil. Boil fiercely for 3 mins, stirring to prevent the mixture bubbling over the pan or sticking, then immediately remove from the heat.\nWhizz the pulp from 7 of the passion fruits in a food processor to separate the seeds from the juice. Sieve and stir this juice into the cream along with the lime juice \u2013 the mixture should visibly thicken. Leave to cool for 10 mins, then pour into 10 small pots or cups. Arrange the cups on a tray (make sure it fits in your fridge) and, when cool, cover the whole tray with cling film \u2013 be careful not to let it touch the surface of the cream. Chill for 3 hrs to set, or up to a day ahead.\nMeanwhile, make the shortbread. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to mix the butter, flour, ground rice, 50g of the coconut, the egg yolks, vanilla and remaining 225g sugar until the dough comes together. Roll out on a lightly floured surface and, using starshaped cutters, stamp out biscuits. Spread over baking parchment-lined baking trays, sprinkle with the remaining coconut and sugar, then bake for 8-10 mins. Leave to cool.\nTo serve, scoop the pulp from the last passion fruit and drizzle a little over each pot. Arrange the coconut stars on the side."}
