{"text": "First soak the dried porcini in 400ml of kettle-hot water and set aside. Pat the beef fillet with kitchen paper to dry it of any blood then season with salt and then heavily with black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan until very hot then spend 8-10 mins searing and turning the fillet with tongs until it\u2019s well browned on all sides. Hold it up to sear both ends as well. Set the beef aside on a tray to catch any juices and turn the heat off the pan but don\u2019t clean it.\nDrain and squeeze out the dried porcini but reserve the juice and tip the porcini into a food processor with the other mushrooms and thyme. Season everything with salt and pepper and pulse until finely chopped but not completely smooth. Place the beef pan back on the heat with the butter and when it starts to sizzle add the shallot and cook for 2 mins until softened. Turn the heat up and tip in the mushrooms, add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and cook everything for 10-12 mins until you have a paste that comes away from the side of the pan. Tip into a bowl to cool, stir through the parmesan if using and set aside. Turn off the heat from the pan but don\u2019t clean it. The beef can be seared and the mushroom mixture can be made several hours in advance.\nFor the first stage of assembly get a large sheet of cling film and overlap the prosciutto slices on it in a row, tip the mushroom mix on top then cover with another sheet of cling film. Either with your hands or a rolling pin, pat it down or roll it out to a thin layer that just covers the prosciutto. Remove the top sheet of cling film and sit the fillet down the centre of the mushrooms. Using the edge of the cling film lift and roll the prosciutto and mushrooms to encase the beef then use the cling film to roll everything into a tight sausage. For the best results now place the sausage in the freezer for 30 mins to firm up \u2013 do not leave for longer of cooking times will be affected.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry to a rectangle a little larger than a magazine, trim the edges to neaten and save the trimmings. Lightly brush the pastry all over with beaten egg. Carefully unwrap the prosciutto parcel and lay in the middle of the pastry. Like wrapping a parcel or making a spring roll fold the shorter edges over the fillet then roll the whole thing around the fillet to encase. For a really neat finish get another clean sheet of cling film and roll the Wellington into a sausage tight sausage again. Place in the fridge and chill for at least 30 mins or up to a day.\nHeat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a sturdy, lightly oiled baking tray in it. Re-roll the pastry trimmings and use to make 6 leaves. Unwrap the Wellington, brush all over with egg then decorate with the leaves. Brush the leaves with more egg. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and transfer, sealed side down to the heated baking tray. Bake the for 10 mins then reduce the heat of the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and continue to bake for 25 mins for rare meat, 30 mins for medium rare, 35 mins for medium and about 45 mins for well-done, making sure the pastry doesn\u2019t burn (you can cover it with foil if it starts to become too dark. Remove from the oven and leave for 10 mins to relax.\nTo make the gravy, heat the butter in the mushroom pan and fry the shallot, thyme and bay, scraping the crispy bits of the pan with a wooden spoon. Scatter over the flour and brown then splash in the brandy, sizzle for a minute, then add the red wine and boil to a purple paste. Pour in the mushroom soaking liquid, avoiding the gritty bits at the bottom, crumble in the stock cube and any juice from the resting beef and simmer for 5 mins until you have a tasty gravy, season to taste.\nUsing a very sharp knife carefully carve the Wellington into 6 thick slices. You can trim the pastry ends and serve them separately. Serve on heated plates with a jug of gravy."}
{"text": "To make the tangerine curd: place the tangerine zest and juice in a saucepan and bring to the boil, reduce by half before mixing in the caster sugar and chopped butter. Once the butter has melted, let it cool for a few minutes then gradually mix in the egg yolks. Stir over a low heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened. This stage can also be achieved in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring continuously for 20-25 minutes until thickened. Once thickened transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool slightly before covering with cling film or greaseproof paper. Alternatively, store in a sterilised jar.\nTo make the ice cream: whisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and yogurt into the curd and flavour with Grand Marnier. The mix can now be churned in an ice cream maker for 20 minutes before freezing. An alternative method is to freeze the mix for several hours without churning, but you do need to stir it every 20 minutes to break up the crystals until it sets properly. If this second method is followed, remove the ice cream from the freezer about 20-30 minutes before serving to loosen its consistency.\nTo make the syrup: boil together the tangerine zest and juice with the caster sugar and allow to reduce by a third before adding the Grand Marnier. Mix the arrowroot or cornflour with the orange juice or water and whisk into the simmering syrup. Once returned to a gentle simmer, cook for just 2 minutes before removing from the heat. The candied orange peel, if using, can be added while the syrup is warm. Allow to cool. An alternative method is to reheat the syrup just before serving, adding the peel while the syrup is warming.\nTo make the meringues: preheat the oven to 120C/Gas \u00bd/fan oven 100C. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually whisk in two-thirds of the caster sugar. Continue to whisk to reach stiff peaks. The remaining sugar can now be added. Continue to whisk until the meringue has a good thick creamy consistency. The cornflour and lemon juice can now be whisked in, whisking for another minute.\nThe meringues can be kept naturally shaped by spooning individual portions on to lightly oiled parchment paper on a baking tray. Or spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/\u00bdin plain tube and piping large domes onto the paper. Whichever choice is made, it is important to leave ample space between the meringues to allow them to swell and rise. These can now be baked for 45-50 minutes, about 1 hour maximum. During this time they will take on a light colour, forming a crisp shell that coats the marshmallow centre. The meringues can be cooked at a higher temperature - 150C/Gas 2/fan oven 130C - to give slightly more colour. If so, cooking time will be slightly less, around 40-45 minutes.\nWhen assembling the dish there are two options: if dome-shaped meringues have been made, it is best to crack the tops, placing five or six tangerine segments on top of each if using. The ice cream can now be scooped or scrolled using a warm tablespoon, before sitting on top of the meringue. The syrup with candied fruit can now be drizzled over to finish. The alternative is to simply sit the ice cream and meringue side by side, decorating with segments, if using, and drizzling over the syrup. Whichever you choose, either can be finished with a light dusting of icing sugar, if desired, and perhaps a leaf or sprig of holly."}

{"text": "THE DAY BEOFRE: Take a pheasant, fully extend one of its legs, and cut through the skin attaching it to the breast. Note where it's hinged to the carcass and sever between the two joints. Repeat with the other leg. Turn the bird over on to its breast and cut away the backbone where it's attached to the breast. Poultry shears are best for this, but strong scissors or a knife will do. Reveal the wishbone and cut it free, then break away as much of the carcass as you can, leaving the whole two-sided breast (the crown) intact. You will need to sever two more little joints to free the crown entirely and trim off a few flappy, fine ribs from below the breasts, then remove any yellow fat, bits of skin, shot or bloody parts from the crown itself. Repeat with the other two pheasants, then wrap each crown in cling film and put in the fridge.\nPreheat the oven to 140C/gas 1/fan 120C. Tidy up the legs, then wipe them with damp kitchen paper. Pack the legs skin-side down into a roasting tin or baking dish just large enough to take them in a single layer. Strew with the juniper berries, herbs, garlic and salt and pepper, then pour in enough oil to barely cover. Roast for about 2 hours or until very tender, turning the legs halfway through.\nWhen the legs are cooked, remove them from the oven and leave to cool immersed in their cooking fat before refrigerating (still in the fat) overnight.\nIN THE MORNING: When you are ready to finish the cooking, bring both crowns and legs to room temperature, and preheat the oven to 230C/gas 8/fan 210C.
